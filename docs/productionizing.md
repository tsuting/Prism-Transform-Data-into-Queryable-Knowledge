# Productionizing Prism

This guide covers recommendations for running Prism in a production environment.

## Security

### Authentication & Authorization

The default password-based authentication is suitable for demos but not production. Consider:

1. **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)**
   - Integrate with your organization's identity provider
   - Use MSAL for frontend authentication
   - Validate tokens in the backend

2. **Managed Identity for Azure Services**
   - Prism uses `DefaultAzureCredential` for Azure OpenAI and Storage authentication
   - Container Apps use system-assigned managed identity (no API keys required)
   - Required RBAC roles are automatically assigned during deployment:
     - `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` on AI Services account
     - `Storage Blob Data Contributor` on Storage account
   - Benefits: No secrets to manage, automatic credential rotation, audit trail

3. **Secret Management**
   - Use Azure Key Vault for any remaining secrets
   - Container Apps secrets for environment-specific values
   - Never commit secrets to source control

4. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Implement project-level permissions
   - Separate admin and user roles
   - Audit access logs

### Network Security

1. **Enable HTTPS**
   - Container Apps provides automatic HTTPS
   - For custom domains, configure TLS certificates

2. **Private Endpoints**
   - Use Azure Private Link for Azure OpenAI
   - Use Private Endpoints for Azure AI Search
   - Deploy in a Virtual Network

3. **Firewall Rules**
   - Restrict inbound traffic to known IPs
   - Use Azure Front Door or Application Gateway

### Data Protection

1. **Encryption**
   - Data at rest: Azure Storage encryption (enabled by default)
   - Data in transit: HTTPS/TLS
   - Consider customer-managed keys (CMK)

2. **Data Residency**
   - Deploy in regions that meet compliance requirements
   - Understand data flows to Azure AI services

3. **Content Filtering**
   - Azure OpenAI includes content filtering
   - Review and configure filters for your use case
   - Implement additional input validation

## Reliability

### High Availability

1. **Container Apps**
   - Configure minimum replicas > 1
   - Use multiple availability zones
   - Set appropriate CPU/memory limits

   ```bicep
   // In container-apps.bicep
   minReplicas: 2
   maxReplicas: 10
   ```

2. **Azure AI Search**
   - Use Standard tier or higher for SLA
   - Configure replicas for high availability
   - Consider geo-replication for DR

3. **Azure OpenAI**
   - Deploy to multiple regions
   - Implement failover logic
   - Monitor quota and throttling

### Backup & Recovery

1. **Project Data**
   - Back up the `projects/` directory regularly
   - Consider Azure Blob Storage for document storage
   - Implement versioning

2. **Search Index**
   - Index can be rebuilt from source documents
   - Document the rebuild process
   - Test recovery procedures

3. **Configuration**
   - Version control all configuration
   - Use Infrastructure as Code (Bicep)
   - Automate deployments with CI/CD

## Performance

### Scaling

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Container Apps auto-scales based on HTTP traffic
   - Configure scale rules for CPU/memory
   - Set appropriate max replicas

2. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Increase container CPU/memory for large documents
   - Upgrade Azure AI Search tier for more capacity
   - Request higher Azure OpenAI quotas

### Optimization

1. **Caching**
   - Cache frequently accessed project configs
   - Consider Redis for session/query caching
   - Use CDN for static frontend assets

2. **Async Processing**
   - Large documents process asynchronously
   - Consider Azure Queue Storage for job queuing
   - Implement progress tracking

3. **Database**
   - For production, consider moving from file-based storage to:
     - Azure Cosmos DB for project metadata
     - Azure Blob Storage for documents
     - This enables better scaling and querying

## Monitoring

### Application Insights

1. **Enable Tracing**
   - Distributed tracing across frontend/backend
   - Track Azure OpenAI API calls
   - Monitor search query performance

2. **Alerts**
   - Set up alerts for error rates
   - Monitor latency thresholds
   - Alert on Azure service issues

3. **Dashboards**
   - Create operational dashboards
   - Track usage metrics
   - Monitor costs

### Logging

1. **Structured Logging**
   - Use JSON format for logs
   - Include correlation IDs
   - Log at appropriate levels

2. **Log Retention**
   - Configure Log Analytics retention
   - Export to long-term storage if needed
   - Comply with data retention policies

## Cost Management

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Azure OpenAI**
   - Use GPT-4o-mini for simpler tasks
   - Optimize prompt length
   - Cache responses where appropriate

2. **Azure AI Search**
   - Right-size the tier for your index size
   - Use Basic tier for development
   - Monitor and optimize query patterns

3. **Container Apps**
   - Use consumption plan for variable workloads
   - Set appropriate min/max replicas
   - Schedule scale-down during off-hours

### Monitoring Costs

1. **Azure Cost Management**
   - Set up budgets and alerts
   - Review cost breakdown by service
   - Identify optimization opportunities

2. **Resource Tags**
   - Tag resources by environment/project
   - Enable cost allocation reporting

## Compliance

### Considerations

1. **Data Classification**
   - Understand what data will be processed
   - Implement appropriate controls
   - Document data flows

2. **Regulatory Requirements**
   - GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.
   - Azure compliance certifications
   - Customer data handling

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Log all user actions
   - Track document access
   - Retain logs per policy

## Deployment

### CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Unit tests for backend
   - Integration tests for API
   - E2E tests for critical flows

2. **Staged Rollout**
   - Deploy to dev/staging first
   - Use deployment slots or blue-green
   - Implement rollback procedures

3. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - All infrastructure in Bicep
   - Version control changes
   - Review infrastructure changes

### Environment Management

1. **Separate Environments**
   - Development, Staging, Production
   - Isolated Azure subscriptions/resource groups
   - Different credentials per environment

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Use Azure App Configuration
   - Environment-specific settings
   - Feature flags for gradual rollout
